Hi, I’m Le Minh Khoa

Lead Scoring Case Study
The GitHub repository link:
https://github.com/leminhkhoaupgrad/Case-study-Lead-Scoring

This assignment centers on enhancing X Education's current lead conversion rate of 30%, with a target to reach roughly 80%. Using historical data from around 9000 leads, my job is to create a logistic regression model to score each lead's likelihood of conversion. This "Lead Score" will help the sales team focus on the most promising leads. The model should also be adaptable for future business needs. Summarize my insights and suggestions in a concluding PowerPoint slide deck.
